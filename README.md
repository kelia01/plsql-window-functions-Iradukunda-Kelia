# Electronic_retail

## Step 1: Problem definition:
### Business Context:
- Company type: An e-commerce marketplace for electronic device parts (batteries, chargers, ...).
- Data challenge: Sales and Customer Experience.
- Industry: Electronics retail.
### Data Challenge:
Customers struggle to identify trustworthy sellers because many vendors sell similar products with different levels of reliability.
The company needs to analyze customer reviews, ratings, and sales data to rank sellers and products by trust level.
### Expected Outcome:
Use PL/SQL window functions to:
Rank sellers based on average ratings within each product category.
Identify top-rated products per region.
Show trends in review frequency over time.

The result will be a report that helps customers choose reliable sellers and motivates other vendors to improve quality.

## Step 2: Success criteria

### Top 5 most trusted sellers per product category/region → RANK()
Rank sellers based on average customer ratings or trust score within each category or region

### Running total of sales or reviews per seller per month → SUM() OVER()
Calculate cumulative sales or number of positive reviews for each seller to track reliability growth over time.

### Month-over-month change in seller ratings or sales → LAG()/LEAD()
Compare the current month’s average rating or sales to the previous month to identify improving or declining sellers.

### Customer engagement quartiles → NTILE(4)
Divide customers into 4 groups based on number of purchases or review frequency, to identify top buyers or highly active reviewers.

### 3-month moving average of seller ratings or sales → AVG() OVER()
Smooth out monthly fluctuations to track overall seller performance trends.

## Step 3: Database schema

| Table         | Purpose          | Key Columns                                                                | Example Row                           |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **customers** | Customer info    | `customer_id (PK)`, name, region                                           | 1001, Jose Mutoni, Kigali                |
| **sellers**   | Seller info      | `seller_id (PK)`, name, trust\_score, region                               | 2001, TechParts Ltd, 4.6, Kigali      |
| **products**  | Product catalog  | `product_id (PK)`, seller\_id (FK), name, category                         | 3001, 2001, Battery Pack, Electronics |
| **reviews**   | Customer reviews | `review_id (PK)`, customer\_id (FK), product\_id (FK), rating, review\_date | 4001, 1001, 2001, 5, 2025-01-15       |

## Step 4: Window functions implementation
### Ranking: 
```
//
SELECT 
    seller_id,
    name,
    region,
    trust_score,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS row_num,
    RANK()       OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS dense_rank,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS percent_rank
FROM sellers;
```

### Interpretation: 
These functions assign positions to sellers within each region based on trust_score ROW_NUMBER gives strict order, RANK and DENSE_RANK show the highest, PERCENT_RANK shows each seller’s relative standing as a percentile.

## Aggregate:


## Step 5: Results analysis

### Insights in 3 layers

### Descriptive (What happened):
- Top sellers: Ranking showed that in different product category, only a few sellers consistently show in the top 5 trusted sellers.
- Sales & Reviews Growth: The running total revealed steady cumulative growth for some sellers, while others plateaued after an initial spike.
- Smoothing: The 3-month moving average confirmed that some sellers maintain consistent trust, while others fluctuate due to irregular product quality or late deliveries.
- Customer Segments: We saw that the top 25% of customers contribute more than 60% of reviews and purchases, indicating a strong influence from “power buyers.”

### Diagnostic (Why did it happen?):
- Reliable sellers rank higher because they consistently ship on time, provide quality parts, and engage well with customers.
- Positive growth sellers usually improved ratings after adopting better packaging and faster response to negative reviews.
- Engaged customers leave detailed reviews that influence trust rankings more than one-time buyers.

### Prescriptive (What next?):
- Highlight Top Sellers: Display badges for the most trusted sellers on the platform, encouraging customers to prefer them.
- Support Struggling Sellers: Provide training and quality improvement programs for sellers with declining ratings.
- Customer Engagement Programs: Offer loyalty rewards to highly active reviewers to encourage consistent, quality feedback.
- Strategic Growth: Use the moving average trend to identify which sellers are stable and worth promoting in marketing campaigns.
