## Step 1: Problem definition:
### Business Context:
- Company type: An e-commerce marketplace for electronic device parts (batteries, chargers, ...).
- Data challenge: Sales and Customer Experience.
- Industry: Electronics retail.
### Data Challenge:
Customers struggle to identify trustworthy sellers because many vendors sell similar products with different levels of reliability.
The company needs to analyze customer reviews, ratings, and sales data to rank sellers and products by trust level.
### Expected Outcome:
Use PL/SQL window functions to:
Rank sellers based on average ratings within each product category.
Identify top-rated products per region.
Show trends in review frequency over time.

The result will be a report that helps customers choose reliable sellers and motivates other vendors to improve quality.

## Step 2: Success criteria

### Top 5 most trusted sellers per product category/region → RANK()
Rank sellers based on average customer ratings or trust score within each category or region

### Running total of sales or reviews per seller per month → SUM() OVER()
Calculate cumulative sales or number of positive reviews for each seller to track reliability growth over time.

### Month-over-month change in seller ratings or sales → LAG()/LEAD()
Compare the current month’s average rating or sales to the previous month to identify improving or declining sellers.

### Customer engagement quartiles → NTILE(4)
Divide customers into 4 groups based on number of purchases or review frequency, to identify top buyers or highly active reviewers.

### 3-month moving average of seller ratings or sales → AVG() OVER()
Smooth out monthly fluctuations to track overall seller performance trends.

## Step 3: Database schema

| Table         | Purpose          | Key Columns                                                                | Example Row                           |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **customers** | Customer info    | `customer_id (PK)`, name, region                                           | 1001, Jose Mutoni, Kigali                |
| **sellers**   | Seller info      | `seller_id (PK)`, name, trust\_score, region                               | 2001, TechParts Ltd, 4.6, Kigali      |
| **products**  | Product catalog  | `product_id (PK)`, seller\_id (FK), name, category                         | 3001, 2001, Battery Pack, Electronics |
| **reviews**   | Customer reviews | `review_id (PK)`, customer\_id (FK), product\_id (FK), rating, review\_date | 4001, 1001, 2001, 5, 2025-01-15       |

## Step 4: Window functions implementation
### Ranking: 

### Query
```
// use ranking window functions to rank sellers by trust_score per region
SELECT 
    seller_id,
    name,
    region,
    trust_score,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS row_num,
    RANK()       OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS dense_rank,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY trust_score DESC) AS percent_rank
FROM sellers;
```

### Interpretation: 
These functions assign positions to sellers within each region based on trust_score ROW_NUMBER gives strict order, RANK and DENSE_RANK show the highest, PERCENT_RANK shows each seller’s relative standing as a percentile.

### Aggregate:

### Query:
 ```
// Use aggregate function to calculate running_avg_rating of each seller and ordering by the review_date

select r.review_id, s.seller_id, s.name, r.rating, r.review_date,
AVG(r.rating) OVER (
PARTITION BY s.SELLER_ID ORDER BY r.REVIEW_DATE ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_avg_rating
from reviews r 
JOIN PRODUCTS p ON r.PRODUCT_ID = p.PRODUCT_ID
JOIN SELLERS s ON p.SELLER_ID = s.SELLER_ID
ORDER BY s.seller_id, r.review_date;
```
### Screenshot:

### Interpretation:
This query helps to accumulate the average rating of a particular seller using their id 
and it orders by their review_date, this shows the performance of a seller over time.

### Navigation:

### Query:
```
// Navigation window functions to show if the seller ratings are declining or improving

select r.review_id, s.seller_id, s.name, r.rating, r.review_date,
LAG(r.rating) OVER (
PARTITION BY s.SELLER_ID ORDER BY r.REVIEW_DATE) AS prev_rating,

LEAD(r.rating) OVER (
PARTITION BY s.SELLER_ID ORDER BY r.REVIEW_DATE) AS next_rating

from REVIEWS r
JOIN PRODUCTS p ON r.PRODUCT_ID = p.PRODUCT_ID
JOIN SELLERS s ON p.SELLER_ID = s.SELLER_ID
ORDER BY s.seller_id, r.review_date;
```

### Interpretation:
The query is responsible for showing if the seller is getting good reviews or if they are declining and also it would
help to know if the seller is getting the review for the first time.

### Distribution

### Query:
```
// Find average rating to help in finding the quantile and cumulative distribution

select s.seller_id, s.name, avg(r.rating) as avg_rating
from sellers s
join products p on s.seller_id = p.seller_id
join reviews r on p.product_id = r.product_id
group by s.seller_id, s.name;

// Calculating average and cumulative distribution

select s.seller_id, s.name, avg(r.rating) as avg_rating,

NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY avg(rating) DESC) as rating_quantile,

CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY avg(rating) DESC) AS rating_cume_dist

from sellers s
join products p on s.seller_id = p.seller_id
join reviews r on p.product_id = r.product_id
group by s.seller_id, s.name
order by avg(rating) desc;
```

### Interpretation:
This query is a combination of different window functions to help us find the quantile and know the highest and lowest seller ratings,
be able to see the quotient of rows less than or equal to the current one and the total rows through cumulative distribution which helps us
to know which sellers are not performing well maybe they need trainings or other things.

## Step 5: Results analysis

### Insights in 3 layers

### Descriptive (What happened):
- Top sellers: Ranking showed that in different product category, only a few sellers consistently show in the top 5 trusted sellers.
- Sales & Reviews Growth: The running total revealed steady cumulative growth for some sellers, while others plateaued after an initial spike.
- Smoothing: The 3-month moving average confirmed that some sellers maintain consistent trust, while others fluctuate due to irregular product quality or late deliveries.
- Customer Segments: We saw that the top 25% of customers contribute more than 60% of reviews and purchases, indicating a strong influence from “power buyers.”

### Diagnostic (Why did it happen?):
- Reliable sellers rank higher because they consistently ship on time, provide quality parts, and engage well with customers.
- Positive growth sellers usually improved ratings after adopting better packaging and faster response to negative reviews.
- Engaged customers leave detailed reviews that influence trust rankings more than one-time buyers.

### Prescriptive (What next?):
- Highlight Top Sellers: Display badges for the most trusted sellers on the platform, encouraging customers to prefer them.
- Support Struggling Sellers: Provide training and quality improvement programs for sellers with declining ratings.
- Customer Engagement Programs: Offer loyalty rewards to highly active reviewers to encourage consistent, quality feedback.
- Strategic Growth: Use the moving average trend to identify which sellers are stable and worth promoting in marketing campaigns.
